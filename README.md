# Password Generator Homework

The objective of the homework was to modify a starter code to create an application that can generate a random password based on the criteria.

The criteria for the passwords are as follows:
* The password needs to be between the length of 8 to 128 characters.
* The user is given the option to have uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters in the password.
* The password is then displayed within the page or as an alert.
